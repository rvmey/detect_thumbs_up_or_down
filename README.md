# Detect thumbs up or down with computer vision, and trigger a command on a remote computer via TRIGGERcmd with Up or Down as the parameter

## New and improved version:

detect_gestures.py uses MediaPipe's hand gesture recognition to recognize 7 different gestures, and it prevents your command from running more than once every 2 seconds.  

- Closed Fist
- Open Palm
- Pointing Up
- Thumbs Down
- Thumbs Up
- Victory
- I Love You
